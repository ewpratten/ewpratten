## More about me

I have been developing software since the fifth grade, starting my journey with JavaScript and Python. Years later, I am now writing software both professionally, and as a hobby in more languages than I can remember. Having two computer scientists for parents probably pre-disposed me to this honestly. 

Outside of work, I almost exclusively develop open-source software, and it is all available here on this GitHub account. On personal projects, I like to iterate, experiment, and develop as fast as possible, which leads me to have a habit of cranking out projects every three-ish days. A lot of these projects are either developed out of necessity for use in another project, or as learning experiments. Feel free to use, fork, and contribute to any of my projects. I appreciate any feedback given in return.

## Notable past projects

In the past, I have worked on many interesting projects of various sizes. I was once a (very) popular user over on [devRant](https://devrant.com/users/ewpratten), and have worked on multiple bots and statistical tools for the site's community, including my first ever group project, [devCredits](https://github.com/Ewpratten/devCredits), and a command-line client for the app, [dr](https://github.com/Ewpratten/dr). Neither of those old projects were particularly well designed or written on my part, but I learned a lot from them, and thats what matters in my opinion.

More recently, I have been involved with [Raider Robotics](https://github.com/frc5024), a [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team based out of my highschool. On Raider Robotics, I was the leading force developing the software that powered our award-winning robots: [Q*bert](https://github.com/frc5024/PowerUP), [MiniBot](https://github.com/frc5024/uBase), [HATCHField](https://github.com/frc5024/DeepSpace), and [Darth Raider](https://github.com/frc5024/InfiniteRecharge). I also developed some [event management software](https://github.com/frc5024/ThriftyField), a [parts management tool](https://github.com/frc5024/parts) for the team shop, [hardware debugging tools](https://github.com/frc5024/testbench), and the team's [core robotics library](https://github.com/frc5024/lib5k) (including its [documentation](https://frc5024.github.io/lib5k)).

I keep my *pinned repositories* list fairly up to date with the best of my more recent projects.

## Repo navigation

If you haven't noticed yet, I have *a lot* of active repositories on this account.

To make it easier for people to dig around and see what I work on, the following are some quick links to the GitHub search tool.

 - [Rust](https://github.com/search?o=desc&p=1&q=user%3AEwpratten+language%3ARust&s=stars&type=Repositories)
   - At the moment, Rust is my primary programming language. My goal is to become a Rust expert. I have been working hard to produce many useful crates to help fill out the selection of available libraries for other developers to benefit from.
 - [Java](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=user%3AEwpratten+language%3AJava+user%3Afrc5024&s=stars&type=Repositories)
   - For the past few years, Java was my primary language. I picked it up in 10th grade, while working with Raider Robotics ([@frc5024](https://github.com/frc5024)). My Java projects are split between robotics, Minecraft mods, and homework from my high school compsci classes.
 - [Python](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=user%3AEwpratten+language%3APython&s=stars&type=Repositories)
   - Python was the programming language I first learned (way back in 5th grade). It was also my primary language up until high school, I have many many Python projects. As is to be expected with new programmers, many of my old Python projects are not of great quality, but my Python abilities have since grown to the point I can comfortably say I am an expert in the language. I also use Python professionally.
 - [C/C++](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AEwpratten+language%3AC%2B%2B+language%3AC+user%3Afrc5024&type=Repositories)
   - C and C++ are both languages I picked up during my time working with Raider Robotics. The majority of my experience in these languages is in the Robotics space, I have a few small side projects in these langues as well. I also use C++ professionally.

I work in *many* other languages, but none have enough projects to warrant their own section here. Feel free to dig around my [repositories](https://github.com/Ewpratten?tab=repositories) page to find them.
