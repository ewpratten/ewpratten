# Greetings, fellow traveler! ðŸ‘‹
**Hi, I'm Evan.**<br>
As you may be able to tell, I work on *a ton* of projects. Despite being open source, not all of them are for general use. I make a lot of one-off tools.

You may be interested in using my [projects page](https://ewpratten.com/projects) as a guide through the highlights of my GitHub profile.
